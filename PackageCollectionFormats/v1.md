# Package Collection

Package collections are short, curated lists of packages and associated metadata that can be imported
by SwiftPM to make package discovery easier. Educators and community influencers can publish
package collections to go along with course materials or blog posts, removing the friction of using
packages for the first time and the cognitive overload of deciding which packages are useful for
a particular task. Enterprises may use collections to narrow the decision space for their internal
engineering teams, focusing them on a trusted set of vetted packages.

## Creating a Package Collection

A package collection is a JSON document that contains a list of packages and metadata per package.

To begin, define the top-level metadata about the collection:

* `name`: The name of the package collection, for display purposes only.
* `overview`: A description of the package collection. **Optional.**
* `keywords`: An array of keywords that the collection is associated with. **Optional.**
* `formatVersion`: The version of the format to which the collection conforms. Currently, `1.0` is the only allowed value.
* `revision`: The revision number of this package collection. **Optional.**
* `generatedAt`: The ISO 8601-formatted datetime string when the package collection was generated.
* `generatedBy`: The author of this package collection. **Optional.**
    * `name`: The author name.
* `packages`: An array of package objects.

#### Add packages to the collection

Each item in the `packages` array is a package object with the following properties:

* `url`: The URL of the package. Currently only Git repository URLs are supported.
* `summary`: A description of the package. **Optional.**
* `keywords`: An array of keywords that the package is associated with. **Optional.**
* `readmeURL`: The URL of the package's README. **Optional.**
* `versions`: An array of version objects representing the most recent and/or relevant releases of the package.

#### Add versions to a package

A version object has metadata extracted from `Package.swift` and optionally additional metadata from other sources:

* `version`: The semantic version string.
* `packageName`: The name of the package.
* `targets`: An array of the package version's targets.
    * `name`: The target name.
    * `moduleName`: The module name if this target can be imported as a module. **Optional.**
* `products`: An array of the package version's products. 
    * `name`: The product name.
    * `type`: The product type. This must have the same JSON representation as SwiftPM's `PackageModel.ProductType`.
    * `target`: An array of the product’s targets.

```json
{
  "name": "MyProduct",
  "type": {
    "library": ["automatic"]
  },
  "targets": ["MyTarget"]
}
```

* `toolsVersion`: The tools (semantic) version specified in `Package.swift`.
* `minimumPlatformVersions`: An array of the package version’s supported platforms specified in `Package.swift`. **Optional.**

```json
{
  "name": "macOS",
  "version": "10.15"
}
```

* `verifiedPlatforms`: An array of platforms in which the package version has been tested and verified. Valid platform names include `macOS`, `iOS`, `tvOS`, `watchOS`, `Linux`, `Android`, and `Windows`. This is different from `platforms` in `Package.swift`. **Optional.**

```json
{
  "name": "macOS"
}
```

* `verifiedSwiftVersions`: An array of Swift versions that the package version has been tested and verified for. Values must be semantic version strings. This is different from `swiftLanguageVersions` in `Package.swift`. **Optional.**
* `license`: The package version's license. **Optional.**
    * `name`: License name. [SPDX identifier](https://spdx.org/licenses/) (e.g., `Apache-2.0`, `MIT`, etc.) preferred.
    * `url`: The URL of the license file.


#### Other requirements

* A package collection can list a maximum of 50 packages. 
* Package versions must include at most two major versions and up to three minor version per major version.
* The package collection JSON file must not exceed 100KB in size.
