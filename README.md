# Swift Package Feed Generator

A **package feed** is a curated list of packages and associated metadata which makes it 
easier to discover an existing package for a particular use case. SwiftPM will allow users 
to subscribe to these feeds, search them via the `swift package` CLI, and will make their 
contents accessible to any clients of libSwiftPM. [TODO: link to SwiftPM evolution proposal](https://forums.swift.org/t/package-feeds/41522) 

This repository provides a set of Swift packages and tooling for the generation
and consumption of package feeds.
